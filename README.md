# Destiny Checkpoints

This is pretty much my first JavaScript project, so I have no idea what the best practices are, or how everything is supposed to work. If I did something stupid, make an issue and/or a pull request.

### TODO

* Figure out how bad this code is.

* Make it work with all platforms?

* Try respecting https://github.com/airbnb/javascript.

* Verify that people sharing checkpoints are actually on the encounter?
    * From my limited experience with the bungie API, I have no idea if this is possible.
